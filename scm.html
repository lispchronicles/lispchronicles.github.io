    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_%28programming_language%29">Scheme</a> is a masterpiece of minimalism in
      programming language design. Being a simple language, it never ceases to amaze me with its expressive power. Its most widely
      implemented <a href="https://schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/r5rs.pdf">standard</a> is only 50 pages long and can be read
      over a weekend. How does such a compactly defined language stack up against large, "industry standard" languages? What is the secret
      sauce of Scheme's minimal but effective design? These are the questions we will try to answer in this post. The insights gained
      may be applicable to genreal system design problems.</p>
