    <p>Random generation of events is important for modeling many statistical processes. In this post we will discuss
      how to simulate the tossing of an unbiased coin in Clojure. We will do this using pure functional techniques.
      We will also write functions to derive some interesting statistics from the coin-toss experiments.

    <h2>Simulating Coin Tosses</h2>

    <p>A coin toss can result in either a head or a tail. We will assign the integer <code>1</code> to head and <code>0</code> to tail,
      so that we can use the <code>rand-int</code> function to simulate a single toss.</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
> (<span class="kw">defn</span> toss [] (rand-int 2))
> (toss)	  
<span class="comment">;;=> will output 1 or 0 with equal chance. probability=0.5</span>
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>How can we simulate <code>N</code> tosses? With the help
      of <a href="http://clojure-doc.org/articles/language/laziness.html" target="_blank">lazy sequences</a>.
      The following function will give us as many tosses as we want!</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
> (<span class="kw">defn</span> tosses []
    (<span class="kw">lazy-seq</span> (cons (toss) (tosses))))

> (take 10 (tosses))
<span class="comment">;;=> (1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1)</span>
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <h2>Functional Inquiry</h2>

    <p>Now we would want to answer some questions about the data gathered from <code>N</code> tosses, like how many heads were generated
      by the experiment? The higher-order function <code>reduce</code> can help us here:</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
> (reduce + 0 (take 10 (tosses)))
<span class="comment">;;=> 5</span>
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p><b>Note</b> You may get a different result, as the simulation includes random values.</p>

    <p>It is well-known that the ratio of the number of heads (or tails) to the total number of tosses approaches <code>0.5</code> as
      the number of tosses increases. To test this out, we first need a version of <code>reduce</code> that returns a sequence of cumulative
      results. Let's define this function:</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
(<span class="kw">defn</span> cumulate [f init xs]
  (<span class="kw">when</span> (seq xs)
    (<span class="kw">let</span> [r (f init (first xs))]
      (<span class="kw">lazy-seq</span> (cons r (cumulate f r (rest xs)))))))
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>Let's call <code>reduce</code> and <code>cumulate</code> on the same inputs and see the difference in their outputs:</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
> (reduce + 0 [1 2 3 4 5])
<span class="comment">;;=> 15</span>
> (cumulate + 0 [1 2 3 4 5])
<span class="comment">;;=> (1 3 6 10 15)</span>
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>As we see, <code>cumulate</code> also returns the result of reduction at each step. We can use this function to report
      the cumulative sum of heads at each toss. We can achieve this by calling <code>cumulate</code> on the result of <code>tosses</code>:</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
> (<span class="kw">def</span> xs (take 3000 (tosses)))
> (<span class="kw">def</span> ch (partial cumulate + 0))
> (<span class="kw">def</span> ss (ch xs))
> (<span class="kw">def</span> rs (map #(/ (float %1) %2) ss (range 1 3001)))
> (drop 2500 rs)
<span class="comment">;;=> (0.5041983206717313 0.504396482813749 0.5041949660407511 ...)
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>The ratio of heads indeed approach <code>0.5</code> with a sufficiently large number of coin-toss events.</p>

    <p>There are other interesting information that we can derive from the data returned by <code>tosses</code>.
      For instance, can you design a function to report the excess of heads over tails for a particular toss?</p>

    <p>The problem can be solved by finding the difference between the cumulative number of heads and the cumulative number of tails
      for the specified toss. We can find the cumulative of tails by first "inverting" the tosses and then applying <code>cumulate</code> to
      the result:</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
> (<span class="kw">def</span> xs (take 10 (tosses)))
> xs
<span class="comment">;;=> (0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0)</span>

> (<span class="kw">defn</span> inv [xs]
    (map #(if (zero? %) 1 0) xs))

> (<span class="kw">def</span> ys (inv xs))
> ys
<span class="comment">;;=> (1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1)</span>

> (<span class="kw">defn</span> excess [xs n]
    (<span class="kw">let</span> [hs (ch xs)
	  ts (ch (inv xs))]
      (nth (map #(- %1 %2) hs ts) n)))

> (excess xs 4)
<span class="comment">;;=> -1</span>
> (excess xs 5)
<span class="comment">;;=> 0</span>
> (excess xs 6)
<span class="comment">;;=> -1</span>
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p><b>Exercise 1</b> Write a function to report the first <code>n</code> excesses of heads over tails.</p>
    <p><b>Exercise 2</b> Use <a href="http://incanter.org/" target="_blank">Incanter</a> to visualize the various
      information you gather about coin tosses. To start, you may plot the ratios obtained from the first 3000 tosses.</p>
