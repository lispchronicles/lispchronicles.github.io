    <p>Random generation of events is fundamental for modeling many statistical processes. In this post we will discuss
      how to simulate the tossing of an unbiased coin in Clojure. We will do this using pure functional techniques.
      We will also write functions to derive some interesting statistics from the coin-toss experiments.

    <h2>Simulating Coin Tosses</h2>

    <p>A coin toss can result in either a head or a tail. If we assign the integer `1` to head and `0` to tail, we can
      use the `rand-int` function to simulate a single toss.</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
> (<span class="kw">defn</span> toss [] (rand-int 2))
> (toss)	  
<span class="comment">;;=> will output 1 or 0 with equal chance. probability=0.5</span>
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>How can we simulate `N` coin tosses? With a lazy sequence, we can represent as many coin tosses as we want, the following
      function achieves this:</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
> (<span class="kw">defn</span> tosses []
    (<span class="kw">lazy-seq</span> (cons (toss) (tosses))))

> (take 10 (tosses))
<span class="comment">;;=> (1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1)</span>
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <h2>A Functional Inquiry</h2>

    <p>Now we would like to answer some questions about the data gathered from <code>N</code> tosses, like, how many heads were generated
      by the experiment?. The higher-order function <code>reduce</code> can help us here:</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
> (reduce + 0 (take 10 (tosses)))
<span class="comment">;;=> 5</span>
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>Note that you may get a different result, as the simulation includes random values.</p>

    <p>It is well-known that the ratio of the number of heads (or tails) to the total number of tosses approaches <code>0.5</code> as
      the number of tosses increases. To test this out, we first need a version of `reduce` that returns a sequence of cumulative
      results. Let's define this function:</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
(<span class="kw">defn</span> cum-reduce [f init xs]
  (<span class="kw">when</span> (seq xs)
    (<span class="kw">let</span> [r (f init (first xs))]
      (<span class="kw">lazy-seq</span> (cons r (cum-reduce f r (rest xs)))))))	  
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>Let's call <code>reduce</code> and <code>cum-reduce</code> on the same inputs and see the difference in output:</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
> (reduce + 0 [1 2 3 4 5])
<span class="comment">;;=> 15</span>
> (cum-reduce + 0 [1 2 3 4 5])
<span class="comment">;;=> (1 3 6 10 15)</span>
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>As we can see, <code>cum-reduce</code> also returns the result of reduction at each step. We can use this function to report
      the cumulative sum of heads at each toss. We can do this by calling <code>cum-reduce</code> on the result of <code>tosses</code>:</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
> (<span class="kw">def</span> xs (take 3000 (tosses)))
> (<span class="kw">def</span> ss (cum-reduce + 0 xs))
> (<span class="kw">def</span> rs (map #(/ (float %1) %2) ss (range 1 3001)))
> (drop 2500 rs)
<span class="comment">;;=> (0.5041983206717313 0.504396482813749 0.5041949660407511 ...)
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>The ratio of heads indeed approach <code>0.5</code> with a sufficiently large number of coin-toss events.</p>

    <p>There are other interesting information that we can derive by writing simple functions on the data returned by <code>tosses</code>.
      For instance, can you design a function to report the excess of heads over tails or vice versa over a number of tosses? Try to achieve
      this using only the techniques of higher-order functional programming. You may also use a library like
      <a href="http://incanter.org/" target="_blank">Incanter</a> to visualize the information you collect.</p>
